# Welcome to our Course Repository!

Here you will find all the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts we use during the tutorial lectures. Materials will be uploaded before each tutorial, giving you plenty of time to work through them. You do not need a GitHub account to download anything.

## About the Notebooks

Each notebook contains simple (non-mandatory) exercises to help you check your understanding of the content. Working through these exercises will reinforce the concepts covered in the tutorials.

## A Note on AI Tools

LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) can solve the exercises easily and overall write a lot of code for you, which can be useful if you need to be productive and if you are able to catch the many many mistakes it will make. In the context of learning, either programming as a whole or the specifics of geospatial data science, it is very counter productive to have solutions given to you. We therefore recommend to avoid using these tools completely. 

**Why this matters:** Understanding the code fundamentals will make it much easier to diagnose and fix bugs in your own projects later. The goal is to build your problem-solving skills, not just complete the exercises.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or encounter difficulties, no worries! We will be there to help you during the tutorial sessions.

Happy coding!

# Schedule

**1. Block: Intro to Python**

During these four weeks we start from the very basics. At the end you should be able to: 
- Create your own notebooks
- Understand basic python principles
- Work with model data
- Create publication quality plots.

If you can already do those things, there is no need for you to be present during the tutorials. It is your own responsibility to be ready for the project work later on!

  -   Week 0 (9.3.): Install Python on your personal computers. Additionally, for those who are up to the challenge: Install git and create your own repository for your project. It is a very good way to backup your scripts and notebooks (not datasets, they are to large for github!) and have a version control system.
  -   Week 1 (16.3.): Python Basics, help with installation problems
  -   Week 2 (23.3.): Numpy and Xarray: How to handle model data.
  -   Week 3 (30.3.): Plotting and reading error messages
      -   With a short presentation on how to make nice plots. We expect a certain quality in your reports!
   
  - (Easter Holiday): A good time to exercise what you learned

**2. Block: Getting ready for your project**

In this block you figure out what you would like to do in your project and we show you how to download the necessary data. Additionally, we will show you some options on what you can do with your data

- Week 4 (13.4.): Downloading CESM-LENS data & Profiling your code

- Week 5 (20.4.): Data Analysis, Choose your project

**3. Block: Project work**

- Week 6 (27.4.): More plotting tips, especially on readable colors. 

- Week 7,8&9 (4./11./18.5.): Data download support, Help with project.
